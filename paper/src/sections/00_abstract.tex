\begin{abstract}
    With the rise of cryptocurrencies BitCoin attracted many miners.
    By using proof of work power as consensus mechanism consumption skyrocketed among BitCoin miners.
    The power consumption of the BitCoin blockchain even surpassed the power consumption of smaller countries.
    This paper looks at other more eco-friendly consensus mechanisms and blockchain technologies.
    These technologies either try to be more energy efficient or reward users for desired behaviour.
