\begin{abstract}
With the rise of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin attracted many miners.
By using proof-of-work as a consensus mechanism, energy consumption skyrocketed among Bitcoin miners.
The power consumption of the Bitcoin blockchain even surpassed that of smaller countries.
This paper explores other, more eco-friendly consensus mechanisms and blockchain technologies.
These technologies either strive to be more energy-efficient or reward users for desired behavior.
