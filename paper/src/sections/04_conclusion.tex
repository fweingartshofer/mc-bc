\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, while there are several potential solutions for making blockchains more eco-friendly, it is important to note that the alternative blockchains discussed in this section\ \ref{sec:alternative-blockchains} have not yet achieved widespread adoption to establish that they are really eco-friendly.
One particular concern arises with the Chia Network (discussed in subsection\ \ref{subsec:chia}), as reports have indicated that mining with hard drives can lead to their destruction within a mere 40 days~\cite{euronews-chia}.
On the other hand, Ethereum's successful transition to an alternative consensus mechanism demonstrates the potential for reduced power consumption, but further analysis is required to assess its scalability.
