\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
There are many possible solutions on how to make blockchains eco-friendly.
As of now the alternative blockchains that are described in section\ \ref{sec:alternative-blockchains} are not widespread enough to claim that they are really eco-friendly.
Especially for the Chia Network, which is mentioned in subsection\ \ref{subsec:chia}, is problematic, since there have been reports that mining with hard drives can destroy them in 40 days.\cite{euronews-chia}
Ethereum shows that shifting to an alternative consensus mechanism can reduce power consumption, but how well this scales has to be shown.
