\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
With the boom of blockchains more and more people are mining blocks for different blockchains.
Bitcoin alone is estimated to consume around 143 terawatt-hours a year according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index\footnote{\url{https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci}, last accessed on 2023-05-25}.

It requires large amounts of energy because of its consensus mechanism, proof of work.\cite{why-does-bitcoin-use-so-much-energy}
This algorithm solves complex mathematical equations in order to mine a block and that requires significant computational resources, which in turn require more energy.
In order to save energy other consensus mechanisms exist, like proof-of-time-and-space or proof-of-stakes.

This paper is split into three sections:
\begin{itemize}
    \item\textbf{Alternative Consensus Mechanisms}: This section describes alternative consensus mechanisms to Proof-of-Work.
    \item\textbf{Alternative Blockchains}: This section lists and describes blockchains using alternative consensus mechanisms, that are described in section\ \ref{sec:alternative-consensus-mechanisms}.
    \item\textbf{Conclusion}: This section will conclude if alternative blockchains use less energy.
\end{itemize}
