\section{Alternative Consensus Mechanisms}\label{sec:alternative-consensus-mechanisms}
This section will describe and compare alternative consensus mechanisms.
Around 60\% of the current consensus mechanisms used in blockchains is Proof-of-Work.\cite{overview-of-sustainablity-blockchains}

By moving to an alternative proof algorithm blockchains could reduce their energy consumption.
This section will describe these alternative consensus mechanisms.\cite{4-ways-to-counter-blockchains-energy-consumption}
